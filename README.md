Accumulate all the shiny things! A pair of integrators, meaning two accumulators are collecting from inputs 1 and 2, capped by hardware limits at -5 an 10 volts.

Non-linear response is hopefully useful/interesting at slow rates near 0 as well as higher voltages. No shortage of glitchy aliasing effect etc.

caw!
